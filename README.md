# Colorized-Sequence-Alignments
Example of dynamic profiles and colors for a sequence alignment

I made dozens of dynamic colorized multiple sequence alignments in support of Virology Drug Discovery and Development programs.  These were extremely popular with the web-lab biologists because they gave them an intuitive way to visualize sequence variation.

### GitHub cannot render the xlsx file, so you'll need to download and open on your computer.
#### I have tested this file with several different versions of Microsoft Excel, Open Office,
#### and Libre Office.

This file has three tabs.  This tab is called ""Notes"".  The second tab has the colorized alignments.  When you open this file, the alignment will be filtered to only genotypes containing the letter ""B"".  You can change this by clicking on the little arrows, as with any Excel auto-filtered view.  Note that when you change the filtering, it will take a few seconds for the profiles and colors to update.

The third tab, called ""Calculations,"" contains all the Excel formulas used to generate the profiles.  After studying these, you may email me at matthewdavidhealy@gmail.com with any questions you might have.

Starting from a multiple sequence alignment of protein sequences, I am able to make an interactive Excel tool like this in about 90 minutes.  It may take you a bit longer the first few times you do this.  And of course if you are assembling and building your own multiple sequence alignments, that will take a while as well.  It takes the LANL HIV Database curators some months to build theirs!
